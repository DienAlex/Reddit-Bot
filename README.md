# Reddit-Bot

## This is a Homework Assignment foe CSCI040
Starring my bot, Totallynotnotabot, I have commented on this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/) after BotTown has been banned.

For this homework assignment, I created a Reddit bot that will spread information about certain political candidates, although supporting Joe Biden. 
I have attached three files to this repo. The bot.py will address the main bot documentation minus the praw.ini file. The spam.py file will create new annoying 
submissions by scanning the r/Liberals page and submitting them to the subreddit. The bot copy.py will cover extra credit 6, commenting on most upvoted comments.
The last file, spamvote.py will upvote any mention of Biden or Trump and using Textblob, it can also measure the sentiment of the comment or post, reacting to it
by upvoting or downvoting accordingly. 

One of my favorite interactions is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r4h90x/comment/hmgn3y3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where
my bot selected the perfect comment for the perfect post.
